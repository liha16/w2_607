RUNNABLE VERSION:
http://casaolive.es/1dv607/w2/index.php

CHANGES:
I did a lot of changes to my code. Therefore my diagrams look totally different from before the first peer review. 


CLASS DIAGRAM:
I did not aim to get a low coupling as the class diagram tells, but a high cohesion. Next workshop is about applying patterns.
I intentionally left out attributes to the class diagram and left what I thought was the most important.
Roles and multiplicity are optional so that is something that I left out aswell as it would add much value. 

SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:
In the "create member" I added more details, names of instances and more correct message names. I took out the db file as it is not an object.
I also decided not to show what happens after the creation is made, as that is "show members" displaying.

I considered suggestions from my reviewers and added what data I send to different methods. Some minor errors were mentioned and moslty they mentioned my assosiations. 
They were bad and I had to change a lot...

CODE:
The static variables are intentionally created as I wanted to mark that they should be assigned once and never changed.
I fixed my "todo-list" from last version, before peer review.

FUTURE IMRPOVEMENT:
I know I am wokring with arrays mixed with objects and that is not good, however I left it as it is because I am running short of time and the requirements are fullfilled.
